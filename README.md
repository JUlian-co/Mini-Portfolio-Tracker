This is a mini EVM wallet tracker i made for fun on a weekend.

Tech stack is Nextjs JSX, alchemy API, and recharts.

Don't forget to put your API key in the .env and after that do ```npm i``` and ```npm run dev``` and test it on localhost:3000.

You can also test my deployed version on https://mipotr.vercel.app
